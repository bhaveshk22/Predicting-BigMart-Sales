# Building a Model to Predict Sales

This repository contains a Machine Learning model that predicts sales for Big Mart outlets. The model uses various features such as Outlet Type, Item Type, and Item MRP to make accurate predictions. The goal of this project is to help Big Mart understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.


## Roadmap

- **Data Preprocessing**: The journey began with cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, Visualising and transforming it into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- **Model Training & Evaluation**: I experimented with different machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and XGBoost. Each model was trained and validated.
